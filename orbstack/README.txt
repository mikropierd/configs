# OrbStack data

This folder is used to store all OrbStack data, including Docker images, containers, and Linux machines.

If you see an 8 TB data.img file, don't panic! It's a special type of file that it only takes as much space as you use, and automatically shrinks when you delete data. It does *not* take up 8 TB of disk space.

To find the real size:
    - Run "du -sh data.img" in Terminal, or
    - Right-click the file and select "Get Info"
      Then look at "size on disk"
